# tutorial-manager
Redesigning the tutorial manager to have dynamic categories

A tutorial website that allows admins to change the tutorial content from anywhere. The admin can upload images and edit each tutorial through the dashboard. Users will have access to a different site that shows the same information minus the Images and Dashboard tabs. Anyone with a Facebook account can leave a comment below each tutorial. I intend to get this site up and running so I can create tutorials for things I've learned and want to learn such as: hadoop, iOS dev, web dev, python, etc.
